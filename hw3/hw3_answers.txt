HW3
Generalization Error
1. Least number N computed ~ 1000
   answer = [b]
Correct.

2. For M = 10, N ~ 1500
   answer = [c]
Correct.

3. For M = 100, N ~ 2000
   answer = [d]
Correct.

Break Point
4. For Perceptron in R^3, the smallest break point is 5. Because the three points in between the two other points can form a plane separating these two points. So we cannot use a plane to have the three points and the two points have two colors. 
   answer = [b]
Correct.

Growth Function
5. Growth function is either polynomial or 2^N. So only i), ii) and v) can be growth function. And these are all <= 2^N.
   answer = [b]
Correct.

Fun with Intervals
6. With five points, the failure case would be +1, -1, +1, -1, +1
   answer = [c]
Correct.

7. By illustration and logic reasoning, 
   answer = [c]
Correct.

8. Checking for M = 1 (->3), and M = 2 (->5), only [d] satisfies. 
   answer = [d]
Correct.

Convex Sets: The Triangle
9. Through trial and error, found that max number that can be shattered is 7.
   answer = [d]
Correct.

Non-Convex Sets: Concentric Circles
10. This problem can be reduced to 1-interval learning model. Thus 
    answer = [b]
Correct.
