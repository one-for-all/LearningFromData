HW8
Primal versus Dual Problem
1. The objective function is a quadratic function, and the constraints are linear constraints. Therefore the problem is a quadratic programming problem. The variables are w and b, which amount to d + 1 variables.
   answer = [d]
Correct.

SVM with Soft Margins
Somehow, implementing SVM with quadratic programming package such as qpsolver with 'cvxopt' would give much larger number of support vectors.
For the below problems, we use libsvm.

2. Implement with libsvm. Find digit 0 has highest E_in ~ 0.106.
   answer = [a]
Correct.

3. Digit 1 has lowest E_in ~ 0.014.
   answer = [a]
Correct.

4. Digit 0 has number of support vectors 2180. Digit 1 has 386. Difference = 1794.
   answer = [c]
Correct.

5. Ran experiment. Other C values give E_in ~ 0.0045, while C = 1 gives E_in ~ 0.0032, which is the lowest.
   It makes sense since higher C means we allow less of the violation of the margin, which should give lower training error.
   answer = [d]
Correct.

6. Ran the experiments. Found b is true.
   answer = [b]
Correct.

Cross Validation
7. Ran cross-validation experiment with libsvm built-in functionality. Find C = 0.001 is selected most often.
   answer = [b]
Correct.

8. The average E_cv for C = 0.001 is ~ 0.0048
   answer = [c]
Correct.

RBF Kernel
9. Ran experiment. Obtain C = 10^6 gives lowest E_in ~ 0.0006
   answer = [e]
Correct.

10. C = 100 gives lowest E_out ~ 0.0189
    answer = [c]
Correct.
