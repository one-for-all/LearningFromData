HW7
Validation
1. For k = 6, validation error is smallest = 0.0.
   answer = [d]

2. On out-sample error, k = 7 achieves the smallest = 0.072
   anwser = [e]

3. With 10 training samples and 25 validation samples, k = 6 again achieves smallest  validation error = 0.08
   answer = [d]

4. k = 6 also achieves smallest test error = 0.192. Makes sense since we are now using more data for validation, which should give a better estimate of out-sample error.
   answer = [d]

5. Both chose k = 6. Out-sample errors are 0.084 and 0.192. Latter error is higher, which makes sense since less data for training would give worse out-sample error.
   answer = [b]

Validation Bias
6. Ran experiment. Found expected value of min(e1, e2) ~= 0.334, closest to 0.4
   answer = [d]

Cross Validation
7. Compute the constant and linear models of each two-points combination, and compute error. Equate the average of constant model and linear model, get rho = sqrt(9+4*sqrt(6))
   answer = [c]
