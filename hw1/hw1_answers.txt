Correct

The perceptron Learning Algorithm
7. Around 5 iterations
   answer = [a]
Wrong - Around 10 iterations
   answer should be [b]

8. Around 0.1 error rate
   answer = [c]
Correct

9. Around 30 iterations
   answer = [a]
Wrong - Around 140 iterations
   answer should be [b]

10. Error rate around 0.01
   answer = [b]
Correct

Note: Each iteration of PLA corresponds to one weight update.
