HW5
Linear Regression Error
1. Compute the Ein for different Ns, get min N of 100, for Ein > 0.008
   answer = [c]
Correct.

Nonlinear Transforms
2. The larger the magnitude of x1, the more likely it is -1, therefore w1 < 0.
   The larger the magnitude of x2, the more likely it is +1, therefore w2 > 0.
   answer = [d]
Correct

3. The VC dimension of a linear model is d+1, which is 15 in this case.
   answer = [c]
Correct.

Gradient Descent
4. Compute gradient, get
   answer = [e]
Correct.

5. Perform gradient descent, obtain that number of iterations is 10
   answer = [d]
Correct.

6. Get (u, v) at end of the above gradient descent.
   answer = [e]
Correct.

7. Perform coordinate descent for 15 iters, get E ~ 0.1398. Quite poor.
   answer = [a]
Correct.

Logistic Regression
8. Perform logistic regression. Eout ~ 0.106
   answer = [d]
Correct.

9. Number of epochs ~ 341
   answer = [a]
Correct.

PLA as SGD
10. The perception learning algorithm updates the weight vector as follows:
    w += yx for a misclassified data point
    which can be re-arranged into the form of w -= -yx, where we can think of
    gradient = -yx, for each misclassified point, and gradient = 0, for 
    correctly classified point. The error function in 
    choice e has this gradient.
    answer = [e]
Correct.
