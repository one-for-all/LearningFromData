HW2
Hoeffding Inequality
1. Average value of v_min is ~ 0.04
   answer = [b]
Correct

2. c_1 and c_rand satisfies
   answer = [d]
Correct

Error and Noise
3. with prob lambda, y = f(x), in which case h is wrong with prob mu.
   with prob 1-lambda, y = negate f(x), in which case h is wrong with prob 1-mu.
   total prob for error = lambda * mu + (1-lambda)*(1-mu)
   answer = [e]
Correct

4. Simplify the above error epression, get 2*lambda*mu - mu - lambda + 1
   If take lambda = 1/2, the mu terms cancel, we get error = 1/2
   answer = [b]
Correct

Linear Regression
5. E_in ~ 0.04
   answer = [c]
Correct

6. E_out ~ 0.05
   answer = [c]
Correct
7. average iteration for PLA to converge ~ 6
   answer = [a]
Correct

Nonlinear Transformation
8. E_in ~ 0.5. Makes sense since line cannot separate data at all.
   answer = [d]
Correct

9. First hypothesis's error matches the most with learned one, both of which
   is ~ 0.1. And it makes sense since noise is 10%.
   answer = [a]
Correct

10. E_out ~ 0.12. Makes sense.
   answer = [b]
Correct
